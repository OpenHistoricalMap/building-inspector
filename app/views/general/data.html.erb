    <h3>FREE polygons for fun (and profit)!</h3>

    <p>Why bother classifying thousands of building footprints if you can't get your hands on the resulting data, right? Well, fear not! <em>Rebuilding</em> has been built from the beginning to be open. As volunteers (like yourself) inspect polygons, the API endpoints below get updated (on a daily basis) to reflect the latest data (both the perfect and the imperfect bits).</p>

    <p>Read below for some basic documentation. If you need more detailed information, check out the <%= link_to "source code on GitHub", "https://github.com/OpenHistoricalMap/building-inspector" %> or drop us a line at <!--<%= link_to "buildinginspector@nypl.org", "mailto:buildinginspector@nypl.org" %> or at --><%= link_to "our Twitter account", "http://www.twitter.com/tim_waters" %>.</p>

    <h4><a name="basics"></a>Some basics</h4>

    <p>In order to understand the API endpoints you first need to understand some basic <em>Rebuilding</em> concepts:</p>

    <dl>
        <dt>GeoJSON</dt>
        <dd>Everything in this API is returned as a <%= link_to "GeoJSON string", "http://geojson.org/" %>. You can easily verify/visualize the output using <%= link_to "GeoJSONLint", "http://geojsonlint.com/" %> or <%= link_to "GeoJSON.io", "http://geojson.io"%>.</dd>
        <dt>Polygon</dt>
        <dd>Polygons are the reason this site exists. They represent possible building footprints that have been identified by our automated process, the <%= link_to "NYPL Map Vectorizer", "https://github.com/NYPL/map-vectorizer" %>. The vectorizer produces some extra metadata that you can safely ignore (and may or may not be included in the API).</dd>
        <dt>Maps: Atlases and Sheets</dt>
        <dd>The maps in <em>Rebuilding</em> come from historical atlases which, rather than being one big map, are split into pages (or "sheets"). Polygons come from atlas sheets which are scanned one at a time and then geo-rectified via tools such as the <%= link_to "Map Warper", "http://mapwarper.net" %>. The vectorizer goes through each map sheet and extracts buildings as best it can. And it's not good enough; that's why this site exists: to validate and improve the output of the vectorizer. Each polygon is associated to a <code>sheet_id</code>.</dd>
        <dt>Task</dt>
        <dd>The type of inspection being made to a polygon. Right now there are two tasks: <code>geometry</code> and <code>polygonfix</code><!--, <code>address</code>, and <code>color</code>-->.</dd>
        <dt>Consensus</dt>
        <dd>In order to create reliable results, we present the same task several times to multiple users. We then run a process to make an effective decision of which value is the correct one based on an overwhelming user agreement. This is what we call &ldquo;consensus&rdquo;. The mechanism for consensus varies from task to task. <strong>This API only returns consensus values.</strong></dd>
        <dt>Geometry task</dt>
        <dd>This is the main/first task for any polygon. You are inspecting a polygon to find out if its shape: matches a building (value: <code>YES</code>), matches part of a building but needs fixing (value: <code>FIX</code>) or does not match a building at all (value: <code>NO</code>).</dd>
        <dt>Polygonfix task</dt>
        <dd>Polygons that are classified as <code>FIX</code> get sent to this task. Its purpose is to create new geometry(ies) that will better match the building(s). The resulting value is(are) GeoJSON geometry(ies).</dd>
        <!--<dt>Address task</dt>
        <dd>Polygons that are classified as <code>YES</code> get sent to this task. Its purpose is to find the address numbers (if any) associated to a given polygon. The resulting value is an array of address numbers with their latitude and longitude values or <code>NONE</code>.</dd>
        <dt>Colors task</dt>
        <dd>Polygons that are classified as <code>YES</code> also get sent to this task. Its purpose is to find the colors present in a building. The resulting value is a comma-separated string with any of the colors. Current possible colors are <code>pink</code>, <code>blue</code>, <code>yellow</code>, <code>green</code> and <code>gray</code>.</dd>-->
    </dl>
    <!--<p><strong>Note:</strong> Not all tasks and consensus types have been implemented. If you <em>definitely have to have</em> those polygons (and we can't blame you) contact us at <%= link_to "our Twitter account", "http://www.twitter.com/nypl_labs" %> and we'll hook you up.-->
    <h5>Pagination</h5>
    <p>All results are paginated by <strong>batches of 500 results</strong> (you can always get fewer). You can append <code>/page/:page</code> to any endpoint to request the specific page. If you do not request a specific page, the first one will be returned. If you attempt to access a page beyond the last page you'll be returned an empty GeoJSON result.</p>
    <h4><a name="geometry"></a>Geometry</h4>
    <h5>GET /api/polygons/geometry/{value}</h5>
    <p>Returns the list of polygons that have a consensus of <code>{value}</code> (yes, no, fix). If no value is provided, <em>all</em> polygons will be returned regardless of their consensus.</p>
