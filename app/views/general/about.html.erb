    <h3 class="major inspector">What's this all about?</h3>

    <p>For years libraries, private collectors and Wikimedia Commons have gathered thousands of maps documenting our ever-changing urban landscapes. These street atlases contain a wealth of detailed information about cities now largely lost to us: buildings long ago destroyed, streets renamed, whole neighbourhoods redrawn or redefined. Making these lost places findable via contemporary digital maps allows us to drill down through the layers of urban change and study our cities in profound new ways. But harvesting the data isn't easy.</p>

    <p>Thanks to the amazing work of The New York Public Library we now have an automated tool that can extract building footprints from these historic maps. It's not perfect though and that's where the Historic Map Marker (and you) come in. Using this site you will be completing easy, bite-sized tasks, to help check the initial results and capture other valuable information. The goal? To produce a comprehensive directory of old urban landscapes (or, as we like to think of it, a time machine).</p>

    <p>With that information organized and searchable, we can ask new kinds of questions about history. It will also allow us to link historical documents to historical places: archival records, old newspapers, business directories, photographs, restaurant menus, theatre playbills etc., opening up new ways to research, learn, and discover the past. Perhaps you could explore a city's past on foot with your mobile device, 'checking in' to ghostly establishments and bygone events.</p>

    <p>Historic Map Marker was adapted from a <a href="http://www.nypl.org/labs">NYPL Labs</a> project entitled Building Inspector. If your interest lies in digitizing maps of New York, please visit their <a href="http://buildinginspector.nypl.org/">site</a>.</p>

     <h3 class="major">How Your Contributions Help</h3>
     <p>Currently, there are four different types of inspections you can perform. Each is designed to extract a particular type of data from the maps. Here's what the different inspections tell us:</p>

     <ul id="about-task-list">
          <li><%= link_to(image_tag("icon-geometry.svg", :class=>"task-icon"), geometry_path, :class=>"link-task") %> <strong>Check Footprints</strong> - This establishes a baseline (literally!). We show you the buildings the computer identified, one outline at a time. You tell us whether it is right, wrong, or close but in need of fixing.</li>
          <li><%= link_to(image_tag("icon-polygonfix.svg", :class=>"task-icon"), polygonfix_path, :class=>"link-task") %> <strong>Fix Footprints</strong> - Take those slightly imperfect footprints identified by your fellow inspectors and get 'em into shape to be recorded for history.<br /></li>
          <li><%= link_to(image_tag("icon-address.svg", :class=>"task-icon"), address_path, :class=>"link-task") %> <strong>Enter Addresses</strong> -  Getting those original street numbers will help us to reference specific buildings in their historical context (and, eventually, to see who lived/worked there).<br /></li>
          <li><%= link_to(image_tag("icon-color.svg", :class=>"task-icon"), color_path, :class=>"link-task") %> <strong>Classify Colors</strong> - The original mapmakers color-coded the buildings to indicate construction materials and use types (residential vs. commercial). Identifying the colors helps us index these important details.<br /></li>
        </ul>

     <h3 class="major">How Is Accuracy Ensured?</h3>

    <p>Every time you inspect a building, you’re essentially casting a vote alongside your fellow Inspectors. We show the same footprint and task to several people and tally up those votes to decide whether they agree.</p>

    <p>While each task has a different means to come to consensus, it’s useful to see an example. For Footprint Inspection, it’s coming to consensus on whether the computer-detected footprint is a Yes, No, or a Fix. We show the same footprint to at least 3 different people, and every 10 minutes we tally up the votes. If 75% or more agree, that footprint has reached “consensus” and the system removes it from the inspection queue. If the jury's still out, we keep the footprint in circulation until consensus is reached, focusing our collective efforts on the buildings most in need.</p>

    <p>The main takeaway here is: relax! Your fellow Inspectors have got your back. <em>It's no big deal if make a mistake once in a while, or make your best guess on an ambiguous case.</em> The community will double, triple, and quadruple check you, and you them. Go Team!</p>

  <h3 class="major">How Did We Get Here?</h3>

  <div class="header first">
    <h3>It all starts with atlases</h3>
    <h4>NYPL’s <%= link_to "Lionel Pincus & Princess Firyal Map Division", "http://maps.nypl.org" %> houses about half a million maps and 20,000 books and atlases published over the last five hundred years…</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="grouper">
    <p class="centered">Our atlases span the globe across time and at many scales. You can trace the Dutch empire's global expansion through 17th Century world maps and pilot books; follow the battles of the American Revolution through 18th Century English atlases; and (as in this project) track changes to New York's urban landscape through maps commissioned by 19th Century insurance companies.</p>

    <h3>Scan</h3>
    <div id="capture-graphic" class="left graphic">
      <div class="camera"></div>
      <div class="flash"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="right"><p>First we create a high-resolution digital image of the original paper map. We make copies of the image and store them for safekeeping in our digital repository. The maps are then formatted for deep zooming and are presented to the public via our <a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org">Digital Collections</a> and <a href="http://maps.nypl.org">Map Warper</a> websites, where they can be downloaded in high resolution and queued up for further transformation.</p></div>

    <h3>Rectify</h3>
    <div id="rectify-graphic" class="right graphic">
      <div class="sheet"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="left"><p>While images of old maps are nice, what our users really want is to compare maps from different periods. The trouble is, mapmakers rarely laid things out in ways that allow us to conveniently overlay the images. Locations appear in different parts of the page from year to year. To make matters worse, cartographers used different scales, pagination schemas, and (gasp!) sometimes didn't even put north at the top of the page. So we modified open source software and built the <a href="http://maps.nypl.org">Map Warper</a>, a tool suite for library staff and public volunteers to align maps to precise latitude-longitude points on the planet Earth. This normalizes all of our map images to the same digital base map, making comparisons easy.</p></div>

    <h4 class="numeral">3</h4>
    <h3>Vectorize</h3>
    <div id="vectorize-graphic" class="left graphic"><%= image_tag "home/vectorize.gif", :class => "animated" %></div>
    <div class="right"><p>Next up is identifying specific features from the maps. This involves identifying shapes (most commonly, building footprints) and converting them into geospatial vector data. This is fancy talk for a different way of handling images on computers. It treats them not as grids of pixels (called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics">raster graphics</a>), but as geometry (points and lines). Vector data is lighter weight and therefore faster to manipulate on a computer (think moving around a large canvas, zooming swiftly in and out). Staff and volunteers have been working to trace building shapes by hand but the work is time-consuming (and, frankly, pretty dull). So to get through these mountains of data, we're training computers to do a first pass on the maps, 'automagically' recognizing building footprints and other features. It works pretty darn well, but as with most image processing techniques, it's not perfect.

    <h3>Inspect!</h3>
    <p class="centered">You take it from here! The rest is up to you. With the help of your fellow Inspectors, you’ll be unlocking the future of New York City’s past!</p>

    <p class = "centered">When all these tasks come together, it produces incredibly important geospatial data about New York City’s historical buildings. You can learn more about the data and how to access it on our <a href="/general/data">Data page</a>.
